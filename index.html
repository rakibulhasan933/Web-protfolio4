            <p>My hobby is drawing, I love to draw. When I was a kid, I loved playing with color pencils and oil pastels. Now I am a high school student and I am still trying to draw better. I hope that I will be an artist in the future. My parents are really supportive and they always inspire me to draw.</p>

            <p>Everyone has a hobby and so do I. My hobby is cooking. I love to cook. At first, I used to help my mom in her cooking. But later I found that I really enjoy cooking. I asked my mom to teach me that, and she was really happy about this. 
                Then she teaches me and I learned pretty much everything about cooking.</p>
